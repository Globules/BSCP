## JWT authentication bypass via jku header injection

This lab uses a JWT-based mechanism for handling sessions. The server supports the jku parameter in the JWT header. However, it fails to check whether the provided URL belongs to a trusted domain before fetching the key.

To solve the lab, forge a JWT that gives you access to the admin panel at /admin, then delete the user carlos.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter

Tip :

We recommend familiarizing yourself with how to work with JWTs in Burp Suite before attempting this lab.
